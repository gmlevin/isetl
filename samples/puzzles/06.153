I was reading the new book ``Archimedes' Revenge'' by Paul Huffman (I
think that is his name).  The sections of the book are:

    (1) Numbers -- articles on number theory, particularly primes
    (2) Shapes -- geometry and topology, with some molecular biology
    (3) Computers -- mainly computer chess and simple Turing machines
    (4) One Man, One Vote -- voting paradoxes and the theory of games

An interesting fact was mentioned in the Numbers section.

    Consider the following manipulation of the decimal representation
    of an integer.  Take the digits, cube them, and then add the
    cubes.  Repeat the process.

    As the book states, every third number has 153 hidden inside.
    (The book offers a reference to the person who made this
    discovery.  Unfortunately, the book is at home.)

It is easy to write an ISETL program that will list the steps in the
above process, printing the integer at each stage.

(1) What can be observed in the sequences that begin with ``every
    third number'' [3,6..N] ?

(2) Does this suggest that there might be a common terminus for each
    sequence?

(3) What about non-multiples of 3?  Is there anything of note in their
    sequences?

(4) Can you prove any of your conjectures to the above?
