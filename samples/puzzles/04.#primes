Searching for patterns: How many primes?
	
Searching out patterns is one of the great uses of ISETL.  Whereas in
the past the great number theorists had to calculate examples by hand,
now we can have the computer churn out examples to test our theories.
And with ISETL, the programs are generally fairly simple to write.

The fact that primes appear in a unpredicatable fashion, with large
and small gaps, is probably one of the reasons that searching for them
is interesting.  Searching for prime twins (p, p+2) is another
interesting problem.  Finding large dry spells without primes is another.

One of the most fascinating facts about primes is that although the
gaps seem unpredicatable, the relative density of primes is easily
described.  An interesting task might be to have students look for a
function that roughly predicts the number of primes less than or equal
to N.  One way to do this would be to count primes as they are
generated and try different ratios.  If #p is number of primes up to
prime p, then p/#p is a reasonable ratio to start with.  Have them
try different expressions with p and #p until they get a fairly
constant result.  Now you can have them try to predict the number of
primes less than N.  Either compute the number for a large N or hit
the library for the information.

This does not address the question of *proving* the ratio of p:#p, but
it should stimulate some interest in the properties of numbers.  If
any of you are familiar with the proof of the density of primes, you
might try to find a series of experiments that would demonstrate the
proof.  I'd be interested in seeing it.
