$ Investigate the nature of the multiplicative subgroups mod n U(n)


$ U(n) = those elements of [1..n-1] that have inverses
$  This may be shown to be those that are relatively prime to n

U := func(n); return { x : x in [1..n-1] | gcd(x,n) = 1}; end;

$ U(n) is cyclic if some element generates all the elements
cyclic := func(n); local Un;
            Un := U(n);
	    
            return
            exists x in Un |
                   (x**size mod n = 1
		    and  forall k in [2..size-1] | x**k mod n /= 1)
                   where size := #Un;
		   end
          end func;

$ The characterization of the cyclic groups depends on the factors of n
$ Consider the output from
$       for i in [2..25] do print [i,cyclic(i), factors(i)] end;
