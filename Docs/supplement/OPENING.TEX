\section{Why read this report?}
This is a supplement to {\em An Introduction to \ISETL\/},
the documentation that is sent with all \ISETL\ disks and tapes.
That document, now referred to as simply \Intro,
is a complete language description.
As such it tends to be extremely dense.
It is also merely concerned with \ISETL\ the language,
ignoring questions about how \ISETL\ {\em works on your
computer\/} and how one {\em makes use of\/} \ISETL\@.

The first topic --- how \ISETL\ {\em works on your computer\/} ---
is addressed in section~\ref{extern}.
The second topic --- how to {\em make use of\/} \ISETL\ ---
is addressed in section~\ref{usage}.
A third topic --- Miscellania about the language ---
is addressed in section~\ref{lang} and covers material that appears 
in \Intro, but with examples and a little more description.

This report was originally written in response to questions forwarded to me
by  Ladnor Geissinger of the University of North Carolina.
As more questions reach me, I will add those of general interest to the
list.
Sending them electronically is probably fastest, but I'll take
any feedback that I can get.
